https://eeckhoutjens.github.io/WebAR_WallDecorating/

Step by step guide:

0) Make sure to keep your device as stable as possible facing towards the wall and gently move it a bit to help it scan the environment
1) Place a point at the bottom and top of surface to determine the height
2) Select bottom left of surface to start defining the walls
!) In case the lines deviate too much from the surface, refresh the page and try again
3) Wall definition will stop if you select a point close to the previous one or if you place a point near the original point
4) Next, you can either start defining doors/frames or immidiately continue to placing objects
5) To define doors/frames place a point at the bottom left and top right of the plane you want to define
6) Now you can select all sorts of different decorations from the side menu
7) Once selected you can press place to visualize them on the selected surfaces
8) ceiling/floor trims have a set location and cannot be changed, everything else will spawn based on the marker
9) You can change certain options / colors using the small panel in the top right of the screen
10) Opening the edit menu, you can select frames / walltrims / decorations and change their location
11) In the edit menu you can also remove all placed object or only the one you have currently selected
